# Credit Risk Classification
# Overview

The purpose of this project is to build machine learning models to predict whether a loan from a peer-to-peer lending services company is likely to be paid or not. The financial information used in this project includes loan amount, interest rate, debt-to-income ratio, credit score, and employment length, and the target variable to predict is the loan status (either fully paid or charged off). The data is highly imbalanced, with only a small percentage of loans being charged off. Therefore, appropriate measures such as resampling techniques will be applied to address the class imbalance.
Two machine learning models will be built and tested, including:
1. Logistic Regression Model with Original Data
2. Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Data
